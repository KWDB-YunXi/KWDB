// NOTE: If one is interested whether the Liveness is valid currently, then the
// timestamp passed in should be the known high-water mark of all the clocks of
// the nodes in the cluster. For example, if the liveness expires at ts 100, our
// physical clock is at 90, but we know that another node's clock is at 110,
// then it's preferable (more consistent across nodes) for the liveness to be
// considered expired. For that purpose, it's better to pass in
// clock.Now().GoTime() rather than clock.PhysicalNow() - the former takes into
// consideration clock signals from other nodes, the latter doesn't.
